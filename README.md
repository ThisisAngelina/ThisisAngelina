## Hi there, this is Angelina 👋

💻 I am a full-stack developer passionate about building robust applications that bring joy to users and profit to the business. I love using Django for rapid backend development and React, plain Javascript, and HTMX for frontend development.​​

👱‍♀️ Before becoming a full-time developer, I earned degrees in business and management, worked in management consulting and ran my own startup (check out Aqt Psoriasis Coach on the AppStore).
