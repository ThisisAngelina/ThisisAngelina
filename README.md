## Hi there, this is Angelina 👋

💻 I am a backend developer passionate about building exciting and reliable tech in a startup environment.
I am proficient in Django (Python) backend engineering and comfortable with front-end technologies. I am also pursuing a degree in CS in addition to my programming work.


👩‍⚕️ I came to programming & CS after a few years working in healthcare management & consulting earlier in my career: I fell in love with software engineering after getting exposed to it through my digital health startup [Aqt bio](https://aqt.bio), now a top app for psoriasis management.
