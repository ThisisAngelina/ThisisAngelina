## Hi there, this is Angelina 👋

👩‍⚕️ I came to programming after a few years working in healthcare.
💙 I fell in love with CS after getting exposed to it through my digital health startup [Aqt bio](https://aqt.bio), now a top app for psoriasis management.

💻 I am now a CS student at the University of London and an aspiring Python backend developer. 

🤝 I am open to collaborating on projects reliant on Django :) 

📲 You can reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelina-chigrinetc/)
